[Speaker 0] on that place so you know some street jostings you were saying many times so what what were you looking at
[Interviewee] are you kind of in
[Speaker 0] the discussion with the reps there about where your foot was and how do you just evaluate that play
[Interviewee] what do you mean i mean it's it's obvious and freedom of what's behind the line of being you can see the space between my line front of my foot and the three point line you can see it clearly see a white the the wood on the floor is is a space in between my front of my foot and the three to five so and i don't just even wonder if you can see that chad
[Speaker 0] it did did tony brothers have an explanation
[Speaker 2] for that
[Interviewee] tony brothers did not but i didn't talk to tony brothers i talked to the other rep and he said it was out of their hands the safalkist or whatever were over there in the replace center or whatever somebody over there eating a handstand which has somebody made a call
[Speaker 0] how do you handle that is there ever a place i'm sure that it's not going to work like that in the past where a game has been decided on any other way
[Interviewee] like five or six of them last year
[Speaker 0] what's the way to handle that as a team
[Interviewee] nine looks stupid when they bring up in that two minute report
[Speaker 3] what did you see or what what kind of look did you get on the final play of the game i i think nishan was after the the buzzer
[Interviewee] yeah i thought i had a quick go but when i turned rudy was right there so i tried to duck under it one point four a lot of time but not as much time as i thought so i kinda misread that but i do a better job i've been in that situation before i just gotta do a better job in knowing the time i could've called him and shot him right away but ant was playing on the high side so i was not telling what he was right here so i was gotta be better with that though
[Speaker 3] darvin said he thought could have been a missed call on that as well some contacted
[Interviewee] there was there was but that was then i'm gonna call that point you know there was closed corners right there rudy maintained right there so but there was nobody in between me and my foot in that three corner line
[Speaker 3] how like how frustrating you to to have something like that you know it's all lines up for you you you guys get to stop you guys were down seven a minute before all of a sudden you have the runway ahead of you you make the shot
[Interviewee] made it super frustrating in the sense of what the hell we got replaced for where do we have replay for if even a replay gets it wrong it's like like who's who's who's a part of the replace center like we got robots in there that making a test that's going on if you don't see that that is clear that is clear like even if even if the shot is released and my foot is on the line afterwards it doesn't matter it doesn't matter once the shot is out of my hand no matter where my foot lands because from when i shot the ball and it's clear everyone can see it so it doesn't make sense and that's a thai game and we're fighting for us and planning a more team in the west right now and you know that's that's frustrating so just
[Speaker 2] to add the frustration we know it i don't know what we're gonna go through today if i'm
[Interviewee] just gonna get out of court can you
[Speaker 2] kind of take it in my way
[Interviewee] i didn't get out of bed today till four thirty so that's yeah super unlikely i woke up my alarm went off at nine when my loan woke up first at eight to go down and get treatment i couldn't pinged out the bed and then i i knew we had a nine forty five bus so my loan went up again at nine i good i still was like need to get some more rest so i took a few more naps and then my father's got a better like thirty got a shot where they help me a little bit caught the five o'clock bus and the guest felt okay to play but i can make some place to help us win the ball game
[Speaker 3] yes play in tomorrow there's like another bounce in that
[Interviewee] i don't know where i'll be
[Speaker 2] i don't know that's it i missed that out in twenty last time
[Speaker 3] that's right
[Interviewee] i mean i feel like you know obviously in this fight it's not gonna help with building this out for tomorrow i'll wake up and go through all the days you see
[Speaker 2] ask question
[Speaker 3] have you
[Interviewee] thought about the
[Speaker 3] the new start in labs just the i was just the third game you guys are playing together with have you seen the scene with us i don't know that your
[Interviewee] ever game is an adjustment for us we're we're all trying to figure this out man you know i know we what we thirty thirty three games now seventeen six in a day third three games in and we still just trying to you know still trying to figure out lineups and rotations and you know we have one of four extra moments in the fourth quarter we had four or five lineups and i'm trying to just trying to win the game so you know i don't think it's ever about who starts i think it's about who finishes on how you finish the game you know so i really don't put too much and just starting lineups you know you just try to figure out a way how you can always complement each other you know you know i don't think we have enough sample size to really dictate of where we should be i think our first game it was the okc game i believe so if i like four or five games of the small size of the north carolina can be actually it's not even that mean because where we started last game if we can't so we we just i'm just trying to figure out
[Speaker 2] i wanna try to most of what i love that stuff because i
