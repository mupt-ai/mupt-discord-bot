[Interviewee] i doing an s and p where you can gain hearts by kill players and lose hearts by getting killed and if you run out of hearts you get banned usually it's hard enough to survive on the server with all the players hunting you hearts and whatnot but i like a challenge that's why i'm gonna try to take over this server by killing a stack player with only one hard this is gonna be hard okay k where am i it looks like i already start off with some basic tools oh and i get armor too i guess this is like the basic starter kit why is there a giant tower up there okay and we start with ten hard so we didn't get this down to one hard now it could just die normally to get down to one hard we could do it a better way you see this s m p has a feature where you can trade one heart for three random items this way i can get down to one heart and get some items along the way that'll help me kill a stacked player but the thing is to trade hearts for items you need more than ten hearts and i did not have more than ten hearts so here's the plan i'm get on my second account and teleport to myself on the s m p then i'm gonna make my second account continuously kill my main account until it's down to one heart and since my second account just a bunch of hearts i'm gonna use those to trade for items than give my main account all of those items boom i'll have both only one heart and a bunch of useful gear so let me get on my second account boom let's go so now this is my second account and i'm just gonna go to my other account a few times boom now have an extra heart now we just use a few more times but before i could continue this happened wait what happened i think my account just called pan wait is there an admin next to me turns out an admin was watching me and banned me because they thought i was using an alt account to reach twenty hearts i have to convince them i'm not trying to cheat to get twenty hearts i'm literally doing the opposite thankfully i explained to them what i was doing they unban my account they unban me okay let's go so i did this a few more times until the use of all of my hearts so we can get back to it and there we go okay so now we're gonna see if we can actually trade these hearts and boom oh my god okay work to work here's the thing i feel like the admins might catch me so i'm not sure so we got this quick so i did this a few more times until a use of all my hearts okay okay there we go there we go okay so now can just give all these stuff boom and then i'm out okay we are back to this account let's see what items we got so we got an iron trustee which is we got another right hoe we got a total spawn egg but as i was looking through my items this happened no way i just got banned that's right as soon as it got down to one heart someone found me and killed me this meant that i was now banned from the s and p i was about to give except suddenly i got this message wait somebody just said corinne i revived you okay yeah they say they revived me so let's go back oh my god another cool feature about this s m p i didn't know about was that you can actually revive people in exchange for ten hearts and someone on this s and p a fan apparently decided to sacrifice ten hearts to revive me and what's even crazier is that when i logged back back on this happened i gotta tell them oh the terrain what wait why is the rain on here t terrain is a member of the actual white seal s and p which is what this s and p was based off of and he had coincidentally been online the same time i was or so i thought you must go go go where leave us you can or minor will come mind manor well her reign was actually here to warn me about one of my greatest enemies mind manor mind manor is one of the best pvp key players alive and he had killed me in a previous video but apparently that wasn't enough for him because when he found out i was playing on this s m p he set out to hunt me so apparently mine manor is trying to kill me so i have to figure out a way to kill him first right now it's four am for him and he usually wakes about eight so we have four hours to figure out how to beat him but for now let's get back down to one hard so i did the same process with a friend next time he accidentally killed me oh joe so we had to revive me to the same trusses again and finally i got down to one heart and got the items we needed okay we got a lot of cool stuff okay we got some armor chicken some gold and everything else seems pretty useless so from all of that all i got was two two pieces of armor okay i'm i guess it's better than nothing now that i had some items i needed to figure out a way to beat mind manner okay so i was thinking of ways to kill mindner and let's be honest even with all the totems in the world there's no way we can out pvp in plus the fact that i only have one heart is literally gonna make it impossible so i think the best thing to do now is try to come up with a trap let's do a thing called entity trapping.entity trapping is a process where you place a bunch of entities like mine carts into one place and a literally squirtier player to death now we just gotta make on the actual s and p to make this job we need to make a bunch of my cards which requires loss of iron i'm talking like four stacks of this so i guess we just start mining i'm gonna leave all the stuff i have right now in the chest because i don't wanna lose it and we're off also there's a pretty chance i'm gonna die while i mine but now that i have a bed it should be okay by the way i won't lose a heart if i die normally on the s and p i only lose a heart when somebody actually kills me oh i can already see a bunch of mobs down there dude this is so scary i literally have only one heart i see some iron there oh no oh no i'm gonna get the iron over there without dying the skeletons are the biggest problem oh no oh no oh no i just have to oh no oh no okay okay okay i just have to go i just have to go okay i was killing this oh what the okay i'm just gonna go back and put these in the chest because i just got eight iron and i do not wanna lose that that was literally the worst timing ever alright let's go back and get our stuff dude that stupid how am i supposed to how much does it do that but eventually we got our stuff and finally came back with the iron okay eight iron acquired five hundred more pieces to go i decided to take a breakout to that and logged off of the server for a while when i came back i found this where did my eye go in my chest did it get stolen or something no that's actually no what okay great well while i was offline somebody had taken all of my items meaning i had to start over and i'm gonna be honest i really didn't wanna do that so i i got some help you know desperate times call for desperate measures yo oh shoot let's go okay we just got a bunch of iron hold on this is literally exactly what i need oh let's go damn alright oh whoa thank you guys i'm a go by so we learned a bunch of things one never leave my stuff outside and just log off and two people on the server are so nice but yeah i think we have enough iron out to make a bunch of mine cards so we can make the try let's go make a base because i really don't wanna lose all my stuff again okay there we go we got the base now let's make the mine cards
[Speaker 1] this should be more than enough
[Interviewee] okay let's start building the trap here we're just gonna make a series of tunnel i'm gonna make him chase me and lead him to these tunnels and at the end of one of the tunnels we're gonna have the my card trapped so hopefully he's gonna fall in or i'll just push him in so i'm mind for a bit more completed the tunnels but after i actually made the trap i ran into a little bit of a problem let me rephrase that i ran into a huge problem okay last layer mine carts and that should be good wait what let me try it again and what yeah see it just happened again they spawned back here's what was happening sometimes when there's too many entities a server can lag and crack so to prevent that this s and p put on limit to how many entities i could play which meant that i could only spawn about fifteen my carts which isn't enough to do any damage so all of my hard work in the making of the trap was useless mind commander could get on at any second so i have to think of a new trap quickly i literally wasted so much iron on these mind cards it's like another trap i could do what if we build like railroad system and along the way we can place these end crystals and i can like shoot the end crystals or something as he's going past them that might actually have to be the play here i can make a bunch railroads sixty four is enough and then we just gonna start making a roller coaster and then if you can't see the crystal so it's gonna have to turn like that and the crystal would be like a ripe harvested does it actually work so yeah there we go boom right here okay perfect and we'll place the crystals here okay and you won't be able to see it here oh my god i'm actually stressed i don't know when he's gonna get on just place the end of crystals we're gonna be really careful not to blow anything up i think three should be enough so we follow the minecart down there and then the minecart lands here we like go snowball at the crystal break it from the other side am i a little safe hold that's something kinda weird okay let's get like a snowball or something now luckily there's a bunch of snow right here i love throwing balls that should be more than enough snowballs i also need to set up like two mine carts here alright there we go we have the mine set up you have the crystals over there set up everything should be perfect yeah and i literally don't know when he's gonna get on so we'll just have to wait he should be waking up soon and after waiting for around ten more minutes he finally got on oh yo okay okay he joined my manor joined my manor joined let me call him yeah hello
