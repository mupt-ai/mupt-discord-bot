[Interviewee] here are thirteen unknown secrets about minecraft one point nineteen starting with the warden and the axolateral might not be so different if you go to the release notes of one point seventeen there's a weird message written in the galactic alphabet that are known as the language of the enchanting table if you translate this it says the axolotls are not what they seen nobody really knew what this meant until the warden entered the game you see if you take the skin of the warden and you input the colors it matches the colors of the axolotl just take a look at this art work and see how similar these two mob actually look like each other beijing even released concept art of the warden and the axolotl playing together and what's even crazier is that the real life axolotl is known to have terrible eyesight you wanna know who else has terrible eyesight the warden i mean this guy doesn't even have eyes look at him it's a pretty crazy theory but you'll be even more surprised by the secrets revealed later on there may be a new boss that's even scarier than the warden and the other dragons if you go to the chest in the ancient city this is a disc fragment in them and you can use this to craft a brand new disc now if you take a listen to this disc here's the summary of what you're here you hear someone lighting a portal then the footsteps of a player the footsteps have become louder and louder then you hear the heavy breathing of something of a brand new monster and then finally the music starts that is so creepy so who knows maybe this is hinting at a new boss there's a secret item in the game the bundle the bundle acts like a backpack which people have been asking for forever let me show you what you can do with this if you right click an item over it then it gets added to the bundle and you can see like the texture change so now it looks like it's full and it can hold up to sixty four so if i want to put sixty four diamonds we got sixty four diamonds in here and if you place it on the ground everything from the bundle gets dropped or you can just right click on but the reason this is secret is because you can't get this in game there's no crafting recipe there's no mop that drops it it's just the random secret eye the only way you can get it is if you give it to yourself using commands i'm actually sure when you'll be able to get in serve vival hopefully in the next update there are now four completely secret paintings so you know if you just place a painting you get these normal ones that everybody has seen for you but no matter how many times you place a painting there are four paintings that can never be spawned again the only way you can give it to yourself is just the command so i'll go ahead and show you these paintings so here's the first one second one third one and fourth one if you couldn't tell already these are pretty much the four elements you've got water over here high over here earth over here and we over here now i'm not sure what these paintings reference but my best guess is this they each represent an own ball the water represents the elder guardian who controls the ocean the fire is the wither because you get the withers close with another the earth doesn't newly added warden because it spawns on their ground the wind is obviously the ender dragon because it can fly being completely on is that could be completely wrong and they could have just added this because it looks cool but i'm just gonna say i'm right because i wanna feel special about myself that golden apple is now you as a secret key so if you find an ancient city and you go up to this portal like structure you'll find a chest right below and if you open this chest a single golden apple see many players think that just a random chest in the golden apple which is the filler for another item that will be added in the future but take a look at this if you go down here and you stand in one front of these walls and eat the golden apple the doors will open and you'll find a bunch of red don't look at that as a bunch of redstone contraption this might single handedly be one of the coolest thing mojin has ever added this structure right here may be important to another dimension you see it has everything in common with all the other portals it's in a rectangular like shea the block made to create it is nearly unbreakable and it literally only appears in set location if you asked me it seems a lot like the nether portal and the end port what makes you even create sure is that these miniature structures were originally named small portal stat you but in the recent snapshots moshing secretly renamed it small stature did they change your mind to add a new dimension or are they trying to hit something to us i guess we'll have to wait for the next update to find out the warden is weak to water so if we build a little whole thing we place it with water some of the warden it should be unable to get out let me go into survival mode yeah come at me come at me oh gosh he gets angry at me but it can't seem to be able to run out of there it's actually stuck oh you're are so stupid oh okay okay sorry sorry take it back i take it back who knew that the scariest mob in minecraft never learned how to swim there's a new block that's designed after the war so if we look at the chiseled block this one is obviously a creeper the most iconic novel minecraft and this one is referencing to the wit and you see the three little schools here in his body this was a little more questionable of navy into the guardian with this one eye in the center that one's a bit of a stretch though now this one this was a brand new vlog to the game a chiseled version of deeply and people have been asking well just also designed after mom if you look closely you can see the warden's two horns and his big head so yeah that's a pretty cool feature they added to this there are new types of villager so if we teleport to a jungle place a villager yeah look at that it's like parzan clothes this is so cool these are other variants or it's the only suit like this okay so i guess this is the only thing they look like the baby ones oh my god the baby's like that too this is really weird considering there's no villages in the jungle i'm pretty sure there's one other new type of village so let's teleport to a swamp and if we place a villager here oh my god what oh that's a little mushroom in the back i guess he just really some shrooms let's compare this with the witch there's a villager and there's the witch oh look they both wear in that purple color but it's also so weird that these villagers exist since there's no villages in this biome well at least you're not lonely anymore oh there's a new and champion book that allows you to mine a a lot faster so they added a new enchantment book called swift sleep and there's three levels of these and if you apply them on your pants you can now move along a lot faster while prouching so here's what it looks like without it and here's what it looks like with it yeah you move pretty quick the original purpose of this is so that these skull sensors can't detect you while you're still moving pretty fast usually if i'm walking it obviously detects me but when i'm crouching it can't look you also get a new advancement for this being completely honest this is pretty useless because you can they move just as fast by crouching jumping crouching crouching jump in and the skull sensors can't even detect you the distant champion would be absolutely garb except when you're mining you can use trapdoor to go down to one block now you're crawling and then chairman also works when you're crawling so now i can move a lot faster and mine a lot quicker but you're gonna a pretty good pickaxe though because you move fast oh you can mark the ancient city on a map nobody really uses maps but now everyone's gonna use it you see if you name your banner something it's name the ancient city boom and you place it here and then when you're map you right click on it look at that it shows where the ancient city is and this also works in anywhere else not only in ancient city you can recreate the deep dark on the surface so first you have to kill a warden sorry buddy that took way too long but look at what it draw this is a skull catalyst it's a pretty cool block and the design is pretty sick what was even cooler about this block is that when xp drops near it it's spread and you can see that there's a new advancement called it's spread so it it literally does quite spread and it just stays there so you can do this a bunch of time let me try one more experiment though we put a skull cut of list here how do we sell it a bunch of creepers look at that the x before them dying is gonna make this spread like wildfire so let's just wait and see what happens okay i think that's enough oh my god look at this it even climbed the tree spot school sneakers and sensor it's still going my god i can't even go underwater this is actually crazy oh my god the dog is now stronger than a normal player let me you what i'm saying so if we get full diamond armor and someone awarded in here we go up to the warden and we give it a little touch oh my gosh it literally one shot us with full dying but look if the warden goes after a dog it dies in two hits while me and full diamond armor gets one shot how is that even possible but look it is just an untamed wolf it kills it in on hit how how does that make sense you guys all over the world and deadly dark ready to kill you well his real name is william that's right william the alibert's trying to decide a name for him and they came up with a lot but in the end they decided with warden but they say how he got that name was because they were trying to write william bahmis pelvis so no matter will anyone says his name is william here's another fact did you know if you subscribe right now you can become part of the og club you're literally so close to two case it was all up to you now what are you waiting for do before someone beats you
