[Interviewee] my friend nico has a secret horror usb drive that contains worlds no one's allowed to see my plan is to steal it from his house to explore the world and expose his deepest and darkest secrets okay guys right now we are driving up to nico's house and i've been hearing rumors about the secret usb drive that he has and i need to get it so i can find what his secrets are i'm actually really curious what it could be yo rico so
[Speaker 1] yeah what's up corey come on i'm in the middle of a video
[Interviewee] day you're recording right now nico was in the middle of a recording so i kinda just had to wait for him to finish until he said this
[Speaker 1] yo i'm a go downstairs real quick and grab something oh okay
[Interviewee] alright guys now is the perfect time to look for his core usb drive okay where could it be i literally don't see anywhere within his room maybe it's on his desk somewhere a grayish shake happy birthday group really he got the grayish shake i was broke still alive wait wait wait what is this nico usb oh my gosh we got it guys we got it we got it okay okay okay holy i can't believe we actually just found it
[Speaker 1] corey i'm coming back i
[Interviewee] think i'm here you could come back
[Speaker 1] what were you dealing
[Interviewee] nothing i gotta go bit i gotta go what sorry to no way we actually got it we bought the usb alright so i just plugged in a usb open up minecraft and this is what i see now it's a world that's called project nine one two three six seven and underneath it says do not touch once sort of project is nico working on and why does this seem so secretive that do not touch is literally in all capital letters so yeah i guess we're just i'm gonna touch it i'm gonna touch the world so let's open up the world real quick and whoa where did i just spawn it looks like i just spawn in some sort of like mansion place i mean we're in the woods and it almost looks like it's a set for another video so maybe it's for future recordings i don't know why would he be so secretive about it though and why would he put it on a specific usb just not on his computer this is a little weird but i guess this we're here and we cut at this little usb we got to explore right hopefully he doesn't catch me he gets uber at me though he he probably will alright well let's just go in and explore the mansion now i wonder what he's what the heck was that what is that noise what what the yo oh my goodness that actually made my heart stop for a second i just got blinded too and now it's raining in this nighttime what is happening i do not have a good feeling about this at all oh gosh i'm really nervous what do these pressure plates do oh oh oh that a that a door open it's okay well i'm so freaked out what is this place it just looks like a regular mansion i mean there's not much here hello anybody home anybody know let's see what he has set upstairs in this mansion i mean there's not bunch in this main area thunder can you chill out i'm trying to record a video please but i mean for the most part i don't see anything wrong over here i mean what is this it's just a living room with a painting on it over here is just a balcony and oh my goodness it's still raining outside really i'm gonna get dresh as i walk out of here that's pretty much it i mean wait what is this whoa it looks like a meeting room with some sort is this where nico has his meetings about like videos and stuff this is pretty sick it feels really professional and what is this future videos question mark arteus' video ideas jumping in toilets jumping into what why would you wanna jump in a toilet that makes no sense eating a hundred cookie a hundred cookie it's cookies with an s and how was you gonna eat to cookies that's so much and the last one is stealing candy that's the entire video stealing candy i was literally gonna break the law for video you're just gonna steal candy from i mean that's pretty sick but is that all this world is created for just for his video ideas you wouldn't build an entire house just for that though is there something like secret behind any of these paintings is it one of those things no no no it's just it's just a regular painting okay and oh oh gosh i i broke the painting oh no let me just oh oh gosh that is not the same painting as it was before nico if you see this that was someone else oh gosh i think so was trouble let's see what the other side of the house looks like now that we've seen over there i mean there's something more cool over here and oh okay it's just a bedroom i guess this must be where you rest in between videos yeah this is literally not in here besides the bed all of these chefs are empty i mean what's in this one and oh there's a book in here actually heiko reads books really i've never seen the kid touch a book in his life heiko bought must be completed soon he will take over for me in videos just need to figure out how to get rid of his evil tendencies what what does this mean is this his dire what is a nico bot and he's saying he's gonna take over for him in his videos also what does it mean how to get rid of his evil tendencies what evil tendencies does this kid talk about you know what he's probably just talking about like this new toy he got or something i don't know he's probably just roleplaying let's just keep going and wait what is this oh i didn't notice is when i came up the stairs but are these trap doors okay let me open these up and whoa what is this oh it's a secret row wait this is awesome i'm not sure if i'm supposed to go in here but i wasn't supposed to steal the usb anyway so i'll be gonna do it here we go and whoa this is awesome and the heckico bot oh my goodness it literally looks just like nico except it has red eyes and blood everywhere oh wait is this what nico was talking about in his book though the nico butt saying it's gonna take over for him in his videos oh gosh i'm kinda scared the blood is not helping whatsoever but it's not moving or anything i guess it's activated right now is nico trying to create a robot of himself that can record for him that must be it that explains everything but i guess it didn't turn out that well because he seems to be kind of evil i'm just gonna leave this alone i think i've seen enough of the usb anyways i'm just gonna go back to where i live let's get out of here and what the is that nico bot no no no hold on hold on i swear he was just here what the hell wait who the what is happening i swear he he was in here but now he seems to be out here why is he looking at me oh gosh okay don't feel good about this at all okay how am i gonna leave this you know what miss and nico but it was nice meeting you tell nico i said hi i i think i'm just gonna leave for now you have a good time and wait what i swear these doors were wood before it where did the pressure plates go wait i can't open this is there a button anywhere i literally can't escape right now oh how am i supposed to leaving oh my goodness okay okay well what is nico bought doing there dude you gotta chill out okay okay call come down can't don't don't get any closer oh gosh okay he is literally just staring at me you know what i need to figure out how to leave this house and the the front doors are just not working okay i'm just gonna scooch pass it buddy and okay okay we are running from him how do i close his doors and these aren't even doors these are trap doors i i just close okay well where are we in whoa what is this is this park core over here why is this here why would nico put this in his house okay okay you know what i'm doing the park core i i am doing the parkour you you just stay there and chill i i'm gonna be doing the parkour now oh gosh oh no i need to see if this leads out to some sort of escape because i am not gonna go to the front doors right now he cobot is literally like just moving closer to me every time i lick away which which is pretty creepy you know it doesn't help that he has blood in the red eyes and has a murderous intent but we're gonna get out of here no matter what and oh my okay of course he moved again of course he moved again hi mister nikolaj come on please i cannot fail again because it has been way too many times jump okay now we walk along here and okay i made it i made it where do we go now it looks like it leads into some sort of hallway there's doors over there i'm a little bit spooked out i don't know if i wanna continue this anymore you know what for some reason all my fears just just completely went away i'm gonna go through his doors no reason at all definitely not because nico bought keeps coming closer for some reason why is he coming closer should not have stolen a usb this is what i get what is this room there's literally no way out of here either it's just a dead end i mean this is looking really super suspicious right now because it looks like a door supposed to be placed here my thinking is that there's gonna be a secret key of some sort around this room and this is gonna open up to something so let's look around see if there's anything here nothing on the roofs anything in these barrels no nothing oh wait there's a chest there's a chest right here let's open it up at oh my goodness i'm a genius what did i say lever boom let's ewing that and let's bring it over and put it on the red wolf and oh oh k there we go now we're making some progress okay what is this it's some sort of broom closet there's a chest right here and another book really what does this book say the other one warned us about nico bot so it might be kind of important let's see and the snake crawls across the board what that doesn't make any sense a snake doesn't even crawl snake slithers like like a snake and doesn't crawl like not a snake i don't know where i'm getting with this guy well that was a complete waste of my time we're just gonna go out and oh my goodness nico bob really he's always still following me and is that a sword in his hand oh goodness okay okay okay what to do now this is not good alright how do we escape from here is this painting a thing i feel like it oh oh wait oh wait there's there's always something there where does this lead to what what is this is this a sewage gosh okay let's let's drop down real quick and whoa what is this this was all underneath nico's house and it's even more power cord looks like okay let let's just jump across i guess not too sure what this is supposed to be it looks like a bunch of oh no oh no guy oh gosh why why are there spiders yummy yummy yummy yummy go play spiders here and what even is that is that a maze of some sort and there are a lot of mobs there actually okay let's just oh no okay you did not you did not have the poison me guys you

okay alright we got a spider we got them all that was way too creepy but what what is this two end your dragon heads guarding a doll alright that's perfectly normal for someone to have in their house the decapitated heads of a dragon just standing there and wow this is sick what is this this is a lava dengue it looks like a kitchen okay why is there a kitchen next along a bit what in this chest oh a shield of four set of net right armor some bread this would have been nice to have when i was you know fighting the fighting the spiders actually but i will take it now i have not complaining whatsoever and what's inside this this is a refrigerator okay frigida let's see what you got for me in oh and changing golden apples and cooked nuts and and poisonous potato you know i'll take it i'll

completely forgot about this guy eco body you stayed there here you know what let me let me touch shooting let's see if it oh okay you know what of course it doesn't affect them that's great that that's absolutely awesome alright bye nico but we gotta get out of here faster what is this oh gosh is this a find a button oh my goodness this kid really did the most okay okay i just gotta click all
