[Interviewee] this is minecraft but every time i die it gets more realistic i'm gonna push my pc to the absolute limit until my minecraft it becomes a real life or my pc explodes will i even be able to beat the game alright we're loaded in and oh my goodness look at my heart right now i literally i'd have a heart right if i someone at thor and i'm gonna die right now and wait what are these textures where even am i this doesn't even look like minecraft this just like mine poop i i couldn't think of anything funny but this must be level one realism and this is worse than the normal minecraft graphics which you know aren't that great themselves i can't even tell what this is what what what even is this it's a it's a cornflour but i can tell that this is a tree so i guess we're gonna start breaking this pretty much if i die then it's gonna upgrade realism and once it gets too upgraded i don't know if my computer can survive that but let's just grab all this wood there we go and wait wait where is the crafting wait i'm so confused with oh okay that's the recipe book wait i literally can't tell what is what stig why does it stick just like square oh god how is this it wouldn't pickaxe this literally makes no sense but okay let let's go down here and i gotta be super careful i don't think fall damage alright this is stone so let's just mine this all up i kinda wonder what the dragon in this realism would look like like would it just be a giant potato floating around would i even be able to tell that as a dragon probably because would come and kill me right away but this should be enough kalbo's stone there we go it will make this kalbo's stone up pickaxe there we go it will make a kalbo's stone acts which looks exactly the same as a stone pick acts i know we'll make the sword which looks exactly the same as a stone pick actually okay great i can't tell which one i'm holding right now wait what the what is that is this a cow the cow literally has no face whatsoever are you sure about that alright i'm sorry mister cal but you guys are gonna have to go i need you for food and wait oh there's a bunch of animals over here are those pigs hi mister pega you are a door but yeah i'm guessing level one just has no texture at all whatsoever i mean hey i guess it makes sense it is level one wait what the it think we just encountered our first mob is that a that a zombie and oh gosh it's on fire what what the it literally looks like a carrot what even is this oh get out of your bro okay okay let's just care of that guy there we go jeez i am not dying this early on okay you know what i take it back but now this means we're on level two realism and oh my oh it still looks a little bit bad like still worse than normal but you know what it's so much better than before oh gosh you just gotta sink everything's like eight minute wait wait a minute what what i i can't look out of my body yeah but this is freaking that should not be happening i mean i guess i do that in real life but you know what i mean and wait are the animals back please tell me they're back it was so weird seeing them without faces please be less creepy and back to cuteness let's see no i take it back they are even creepier why do their eyes just like black souls like what i meant why when i look into the eyes i see an empty soul okay well yeah you're gonna be going bye mister and piggy you too are you still creepy yeah you know what you're a little bit less creepy oh you know what we need to do right now we need to go and try and find a village with something because they're gonna have everything that i need okay we finally found a village let's go mister village mister village what do you guys look like why there literally no villagers around here did the realism level scare them away i literally cannot say oh wait there's a villager there's a villager it's the villager hello sir and oh okay he looks kinda normal okay why are you staring at me so intently bro chill out and now that we're here we can come and you know do what we do to every village steal their food burn their houses kill the babies they they kill the iron golem they pretty much raid it oh you know what that's probably why he was staring at me like that but so go on come here i'm gonna kill you okay please don't hit me and whoa he looks like a robot with this texture pack on he looks awesome do more shots and he should be dead perfect we got his iron now anyway just wanna take him out let's just feel the rest of the bread too because we don't want these villagers happy you know number one rule of minecraft never let a villagers be happy isn't that mister villager uh-oh okay okay well that was a little scary okay but we should have enough food and everything for the last sort of lifetime so let's go down into their caves i don't wait actually before i forget let me actually make a shield because that's gonna stop most of the damage that we're gonna take boom there we go and now oh my goodness i can literally see myself carrying this shield too this is so wonky first things first we need to get some iron and whoa this iron does not even look like iron wait oh wait a minute did i just did i lose skill oh my goodness really i didn't even realize it was behind me bro come on alright we're now on level three and what time is this sweet everything looks like it doesn't look realistic but it looks a little bit cartoonish oh my goodness wait the villagers they have like a different animation did he just smile at me i swear he just smiled oh hold on hold on let me try punching it let's see what happens oh my goodness look at the way he runs oh that is awesome he literally runs at a completely different animation wait wait okay before i go mining again i wanna see if there's any other animations is there any animals around here that i could see oh wait there's pig's literally right over there okay okay let's see oh my goodness okay come on mister piggy oh wait he snows it's like it's oaky do you see that oh my goodness that is adorable look at punching him and he has a different head of it okay that is that is way too cool you are adorable mister no mercy you know what maybe we should stop harassing the animals let's go inside the cave and see what it is like okay we gotta be super duper careful because last time we died right away because i didn't notice the skeleton behind me we could not let that happen again oh okay there's a creeper there's a creeper right over there it was okay mister creepers right
