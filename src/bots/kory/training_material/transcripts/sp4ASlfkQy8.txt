[Interviewee] i'm a little scared but here we go oh you actually can if you don't have any water around just grab some powder to snow you can light two end portal frames at the same time okay i honestly don't know what's gonna happen
[Speaker 2] three two
[Interviewee] and one okay it's only one of the portals lights up oh it would have been so cool if both of these
[Speaker 2] lit up it is one's false
[Interviewee] okay so we know the answer for the end portal what about this nether portal three two one okay same with this one only one if it lights up huller bears will attack foxes i'm not sure why they would be programmed to do this but let's just check so let me spawn a fox oh my god what weighted actually does do polar bears attack foxes in real life i don't know but i guess this one's true cats don't take fall damage okay i'm sorry little one oh wait what he's perfectly fine i can say do always land on their feet true mobs can't see through sugarcane i doubt this one but let's just try it out game outs your bible no we can definitely see can definitely see me that one is false zombies can't hit you through armor stand okay let's see nope the armor stands are absolutely useless why is this not even a question it's all obviously falls zombie sometimes drop baked potatoes alright let's get to get in these zombies oh this one dropped one yeah it's true gas can't shoot fireballs underwater oh here it goes oh it shoots apparently fine i think it gets slowed down a little but besides that but yeah they seem to shoot it fine you can crowd surf a group of moms there's a boat here and here we go oh you actually can why and you go surprisingly fast too it's like you're sliding over eyes but yeah true gassed can't swim

[Speaker 2] oh is he performing magic no wait what
[Interviewee] wait he actually just turned red
[Speaker 2] that's weird but it's true
[Interviewee] you can share a snow go alone
[Speaker 2] oh are you serious is that what they actually look like underneath
[Interviewee] why don't they just make it like this from the start but yeah true gollums are immune to fall then alright let's start with the snow go alone yeah he didn't take any damage alright that will make sense because he landed on but i doubt this guy won't take fall damage alright let's see what he also didn't take any fall damage true striking a villager with lightning turns it into a witch under
[Speaker 2] yeah oh no it's no way it's actually a witch now
[Interviewee] look at the wart on its so true parents dance if you play music i hope this is an issue is gonna be so cute

[Speaker 2] oh we picked it up
[Interviewee] alright let's see if this will it works what that is actually sick he can use that that'd be surprising but yeah it's true you can stack slabs so i set up slabs new a world border and there's a piston right here that'll push them together i honestly have no idea what's gonna happen so let's just try it out and know and literally just pushes the block through the border so it definitely doesn't work so tall you'll find diamonds if you dig straight down at spawn so let's create a new world okay so we just spawn and let's dig straight down i really thought that was diamonds for a second no diamonds i made this one it's pretty obvious it was false making eye contact with enderman makes them not move oh god oh god he's right behind me alright now if we look at his eyes no wait what he actually can't move this one is true i'm sorry and there may can't be provoked through glass everyone knows if you look at an enderman in his eyes and it gets angry but does it work through glass let's see you get it let's see because like eyes hello mister enderman hello can you see me i don't think he's getting angry yeah this was true you can't make them angry through glass frogs can't take fall damage mister frog you're ready for liftoff well i don't care here you go oh you can definitely take fall damage falls enderman can't move in call webs unless they're shot at or splashed water on that okay first let's test out the bow oh yeah you just tell the boy's out what about the water here we go that's true i guess they're like cats they just don't like water at all so yeah both are true mud makes you slower so first let's just walk on normal wood planks yeah but you know pretty average alright now what about the mud that feels exactly the same so obviously this one's false and they're in sea and inverted colors let's go on spectator mode oh way one to actually don't see everything inverted colors we disguise like brown that must be so depressing to look at but yeah it's true crouching on magma blocks makes you take no damage
