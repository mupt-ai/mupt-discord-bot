[Speaker 2] be like monster hunter or something
[Interviewee] i have idea dude i honestly can't tell dude but i'm happy that a dick because now the world border even expanded and wait a minute let me see let me use my x-ray again and it's our iron any that we can get to we is that oh still there's nothing inside our reach okay i have to get back up to the surface but i don't wanna build up there and i can't have ziggy know yo ziggy look behind you in the counter ten
[Speaker 2] oh we're playing hide and seek yeah
[Interviewee] yeah that's exactly what we're doing
[Speaker 2] it's kinda small for that but okay one two alright
[Interviewee] now while he's not looking let me go into my hacker menu and go into creative moon and i can just fly all the way up to the surface and he'll never know oh gosh we kinda just dropped out i can't have him see me oh no sores up there okay okay let me get over here real quick and before i get out let me go ahead and grab an iron ingot there we go
[Speaker 2] love than ten fourteen and ten

[Speaker 2] hit the i don't know where's corey
[Interviewee] he thought he was with you
[Speaker 2] i'm all
[Interviewee] the way up at the table bro
[Speaker 1] what this is suspicious corey
[Interviewee] what do you mean suspicious only suspicious is your face
[Speaker 1] heck your face is suspicious i got my eyes
[Interviewee] okay are you serious dudes a a stop trip in low bro and wait a minute guys to get other advancements we have to kill a hostile mob we trade with the villager okay these honestly aren't that bad but the next thing i think we should do is we need to get a iron pickaxe yeah but there's no iron around anywhere dude
[Speaker 2] oh i
[Interviewee] have one iron in it
[Speaker 2] how if
[Speaker 1] it is one enough to make a pickaxe corey
[Interviewee] oh wait a minute hold up actually it turns out i actually have eight iron ingots what eight of them do that
[Speaker 2] wait corey i killed a silverfish
[Interviewee] oh let's go that means our thing expanded even more and what they don't know is that i have a duplicate button right which lets me duplicate anything so now i have an entire stack guys i you know i just counted wrong so i turns out i i have three iron ingots what the whoa
[Speaker 1] but didn't you say you have eight
[Interviewee] no no no no no no that's that's not what i said so how did you keep it
[Speaker 1] i have cut my eye on you corey

[Speaker 2] good idea
[Interviewee] okay let me start building up i'll see you boys at the top and let me go ahead and go to my hacker you go into spectator mode so i could fly all the way up here real quick and it doesn't look like anyone's nearest beside some mobs so i can go and head back to survival mode oh oh gosh okay baby that was just so smart guys there's a bunch of bombs here there's a bunch of bombs here you did that to yourself oh my god a bunch of mobs oh my holy boy i always just died but i thankfully got into creative mode just in time okay let me go ahead and kill all these guys
[Speaker 2] a bunch of mobs yes there are oh my gosh
