[Interviewee] the life steel s and p is known as one of the deadliest minecraft servers it's well known due to a feature where if you kill another player you gain a heart but if you die you lose now because a lifestyle s and p is so successful someone was bound to copy it and someone did so i decided to kill the most deadly player on this fake lifestyle s and p and take it over what is this okay so i'm looking at the health and i'm guessing everyone starts with ten health which is what i have and the max you can get is twenty health so in order to think kill the deadliest player we need to get twenty hearts choose your desired teleport destination okay so this is despondent in the real world alright let's just go in the first one okay what is this wait what already someone wants to teleport to me oh it's a fan what's up bro oh that's sick he gave me a diamond oh okay i realized something this meant that if i had fans on here i might be able to get powerful stuff a lot easier i mean obviously i'm not gonna force him to give him the it's just like you know if they if they have any extra stuff that they don't need i need all the help i can get to kill the deadliest player okay but let's just start with the basics let's get some food wait one sec i'm a huge fan do you want some free stuff is this guy tricking me or not i i okay tpa i can't tell if this guy's doing this just because he wants to kill me and steal my heart or if he's legit i mean i i i guess we'll test it out like he did say he was a fan okay what is this wait what the stuff is in this chest let me see holy crap this is definitely gonna help us kill the deadliest player i think that's all we need okay oh what if we tell someone we wanna trade and no one to teleport here we kill him okay the message has now been sent someone's coming okay so i i guess we just wait for him oh he's coming he's coming he's coming he's coming okay here he is let's go okay got his heart now one step closer to killing the deadliest player on this s m p so we figured out how to trick people to kill them and steal their hearts now need to figure out who the deadliest player is so we can target them who's the best player on this s m p and i got an answer immediately his name is stray who is this guy i did a little more research on him and it turns out this guy is literally one of the best pb peers in minecraft even as a youtube channel where he fights the best players now we know who our target is but to kill him we need to get more heart oh this guy wants a team he pay mushy aid in first oh okay let's kill it let's kill it die let's go another person requests the teleport okay okay let's go i'm so sorry bro
[Speaker 1] oh my god this is so easy i almost feel bad
[Interviewee] but then he decided to get revenge with one of his friends oh wait he wants a tipi again i mean i guess that's another free hard yeah okay so he's here yo why who is this glancing kid yo yo yo why is he glancing over okay okay okay why is he following me okay why why okay okay okay now he's killing me i'm gonna get out of here okay okay oh my god okay so i can just slash hog to escape what the heck what i didn't know was this was a fatal mistake because apparently there's a thing called a combat timer it prevents players from logging off whenever they're losing a fight and if they do log off before the time rise ended then they're killed instantly i didn't know about that so i lost all my items am i he's just still gonna wait what you can die from that i still have my hearts but they took all my stuff no no it seemed like all hope was lost i had absolutely nothing and it would take days to get that loop would i even be able to kill the dead latest player or if it's too difficult of a test room maybe i should just give up but then something weird happened the guy who killed me glanson who is one of the most stacked clearance on the s and p suddenly requested to trade with me he wants it trade okay wait what no he's gonna pull out he's gonna pull out no way no way what wait what god a heck full netherite i'm actually so confused turns out after he killed me he found out i was a youtuber and he gave me full enchanted netherite armor in exchange for a signature oh what
[Speaker 1] subscribe korean there you go i literally would have given it to for free too
[Interviewee] now we're halfway to being able to kill the deadliest player so we're gonna keep asking people to trade and then steal their hearts to key to me if you want to trade and now we wait let's go i'm so sorry goodbye goodbye one more hard this guy named best player says
[Speaker 1] to keep you for team and that he's new but he has twenty hearts so he's definitely lied
[Interviewee] i do need one more heart failure so i'm gonna see if i can kill him oh wait what is this wait what is this turns out while
[Speaker 1] i thought i was tricking him he was tricking me okay
[Interviewee] this kid donnie could kill me okay okay yo let's go
[Speaker 1] oh let's go this kid actually thought he could kill me he's been only two hours and now i have twenty hearts
[Interviewee] with both the netrite armor and the twenty hearts we were now one of the strongest players on the server now it like we had a chance at defeating the deadliest player but then someone challenged me to a duel okay they're saying one v one v me i guess i do need to test my skills before the final fight little did i know this is one of the players that i was warned about earlier he was the second best player on this s and p going by the name you chia crystalline i just accepted a duel to the dead with them okay okay you just start okay go road things i don't know that trick hey my sword is three times your

[Speaker 1] bite him that guy is good
[Interviewee] i should have just left there except you requested to teleport me again to finish the duel instead of being actually smart for once in denying i got cocky and tried to set up a trap to kill him wait he requested the teleport again okay wait i'll just set up a trap like this and kill him instantly okay i apologize i apologize okay oh my god he does so much damage with that no okay okay okay okay okay but a cat's worst i was running away at my combat timer finally hit zero so i could escape but as soon as it went back to the lobby for some dumb reason i decide to go right back okay wait i didn't lose myself right wait

[Interviewee] so i was on the run again oh my god oh okay i can hear how i can hear oh no oh my god that just reset my combat timer please give me out of here okay okay one okay five more seconds okay okay okay okay okay okay we're safe holy crap holy crap we are not joining back for a while seeing how strong the second best player was i tried thinking of traps to kill straight for an easy victory but in the end i decided just do a fair one v one so i got in contact with them set at the time of the duel and began the final battle straight you ready bro
