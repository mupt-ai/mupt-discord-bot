[Speaker 2] no but i do see a trail of blood
[Interviewee] a trail of blood that issue are we sure this is starz's blood
[Speaker 2] wait corey over here wait
[Interviewee] wait what do you mean what what what does a knife holy moly is is this actual sword
[Speaker 2] i guess this is what the murderer used to get rid star

[Speaker 2] me tell me
[Speaker 3] wait why won't i say that
[Interviewee] oh my gosh kai that's super duper sucks but now that i admit it all three of us are kinda clubs

[Speaker 2] oh perfect
[Speaker 3] i thought we already figured that part out who else could be the murderer
[Interviewee] it's true oh wait he's loki spitting facts dude no back to square one oh
[Speaker 3] i don't like shapes
[Speaker 2] oh oh square oh whatever
[Interviewee] alright brother that was such a cordy day yeah that was

[Speaker 2] gotta worry what is wait orange fabric
[Interviewee] guys let's what is this
[Speaker 2] orange fabric and blood is all over this place corey
[Interviewee] this doesn't mean on the motor could have had like a nosebleed or something

[Speaker 2] kai you need to trust me on this look smell and it even smells like corey
[Interviewee] okay but how do we know this blood is stars this could be own blood i did have a lot of nosebleeds the other day

[Interviewee] nosebleed in this room corey yeah i i don't remember i was lokey dripping everywhere wow then
[Speaker 2] why didn't you tell us about it
[Interviewee] alright you know what it's fine you know how we figured this out i have a dna tester machine upstairs and we can use that to figure out whose blood this is and we can get the blood from a star's body and see whose blood that is
[Speaker 2] sounds good
[Speaker 3] you didn't think to suggest that earlier
[Interviewee] oh okay well we knew it was stars blood
[Speaker 3] oh yeah true
[Interviewee] okay i got the two bloods blood a is a blood from here blood b is the blood from over there next to you know the orange fabric is totally not my clothes
[Speaker 2] yeah let's go
[Interviewee] alright everybody stay close together ziggy keep an eye on kai kai keep an eye on me and i'm a keep an eye i don't really know on ziggy i guess
[Speaker 2] what the that's like that doesn't even make any sense
[Interviewee] you don't make any sense i make dollars alright let's go all the way over here and welcome to my dna tester
[Speaker 2] corey this is a gaming pc
[Interviewee] no it's not it can also be a dna tester it's very advanced
[Speaker 3] oh yeah what program are you gonna use
[Interviewee] i'm gonna use your mom dot com you don't know because you're not smart like me okay i have a dna test on this i don't think you guys know how opie this computer is
[Speaker 2] alright let's right out then
[Speaker 1] okay bibb bibb bibb bibbibbibbibbibbibbibbibbibbibbibbibbibbibbibbibbibbib
[Interviewee] alright inserting the first dnabibbibbibbibbibbibbibbibbibbibbibbibbibbibbibbibbibbibbibbibbibbibbibbibbibbibbibbibbibbibbibbibbibb alright and wait guys i got it i got the dna testers all
[Speaker 2] let's go
[Speaker 3] what did they say
[Interviewee] let's see three two one people match what wait so the blood from star's body and the blood next to orange fabric aren't the same which means i'm not the murderer i'm not the murderer uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh take a look at my cheek she says i'm not the murderer corey
[Speaker 2] oh yeah lookin' at corsi what up no siggi what the okay sorry sorry sorry i i got two inches i got two inches i'm sorry
[Speaker 3] oh my gosh i need to get out of this bedroom leaving you alone alright if it doesn't match then who's is it
[Interviewee] i i don't know it's probably my nosebleed i told
[Speaker 2] you i guess i should have believed you earlier
[Interviewee] yeah that's what i thought alright you know what let's look you just keep looking around there's gotta be some other hints around here but maybe we could keep looking around yeah nothing here my are you kidding me no way corey
[Speaker 2] corey at first i thought you were innocent but now there's an orange shirt and more blood okay
[Interviewee] okay you know i was having my nosebleed those days
[Speaker 3] okay uh-huh corey earlier i wasn't here the entire time i didn't see you here once
[Interviewee] okay listen i don't know how this shirt got
[Speaker 3] an entire shirt and you don't know how it got here
[Interviewee] no i have no idea
[Speaker 3] so you do believe that
[Speaker 2] well i mean he is wearing another shirt did you happen to bring up a spare shirt i never bought a shirt in here guys
[Interviewee] i don't know what this is wait hold on what
[Speaker 2] guys what if someone's tried a frame course
[Interviewee] oh i agree yep definitely a hundred percent and you know what it's kinda such that he mentioned it because only a murder would think like or and because only one thing like a murder a ziggy ziggy must be the murderer ziggy
[Speaker 2] what the yo that's a lot of leaps and judgment there i was just assuming someone framed you corey
[Interviewee] plain me i know pictures ziggy
[Speaker 2] what the yo
[Speaker 3] no but those
[Speaker 2] are behind you but they're like that's not i'm not trying to talk about framing like that
[Interviewee] you know what wait a minute you just give me a good idea there's a lot of times when the murder uses paintings to hide secret entrances quick everybody job at the paintings let's see if there's anything here dude i've checked a ton of the paintings then none of them are actually here
[Speaker 3] yeah i'm not getting it i'm not able to get into any of them
[Interviewee] guys guys guys over here over here over
[Speaker 2] here coming
[Speaker 3] wow where i
[Interviewee] had my nosebleed with all my orange fabric here yeah what about like jump right inside here no way there's a secret painting entrance here oh my yo there's an entire area and wait there's a knife here what another one meijo which means this is probably the murderism
[Speaker 3] and there's orange bedsheet
[Interviewee] oh okay okay you know what why does everything have to be orange guys i understand that you know orange is my thing but just because it is does it mean yeah you eat oh hi this is by row corey
[Speaker 3] corey your nosebleed happened right by this room all in room orange fabric
[Interviewee] oh gosh okay everybody chill out
[Speaker 2] boy there's too many coincidence here there's no way we're taking you out
[Interviewee] right now don't it's not me guys chella chella chella
[Speaker 3] it's gotta be you coy there's no other way
[Interviewee] wait everybody chill out i just also what'd
[Speaker 3] you say what
[Interviewee] there's a look look there's a diary here somebody left a diary
[Speaker 2] alright what does it say you mean your diary
[Interviewee] let me go ahead and read it okay come on it says dear diary i've been feeling blue late lee might have to kill someone soon
[Speaker 2] you've been feeling what the that doesn't sound like
[Interviewee] this sounds weird guys wait should i read it again
[Speaker 2] yeah read it sure
[Interviewee] dear diary i've been feeling blue lately might have to kill someone soon feeling blue lately feeling blue who feels blue
[Speaker 2] well i've been saddle off but that's not my color kai what you're blue
[Speaker 3] no i'm kai
[Interviewee] no he he say the color is blue
[Speaker 3] oh well that can't be me
[Speaker 2] that sound that sounds really weird coming from you now honestly you were trying to frame core awareness
[Speaker 3] oh that was your idea what
[Interviewee] this is super duper weird ziggy why are you still trying to say any people framed other people i feel like you could be the murderer why would
[Speaker 2] i be the murderer i i'm i'm not really that blue cut how is blue
[Interviewee] it is true as well wait there's books in here only stars are one that read books guys this is so weird oh dang i guess about her i'm so lost
[Speaker 2] oh just give me a headache wait
[Interviewee] i thought a virginia's idea we wait in this room until the murder kills us all and the last one standing is a murderer and then we don't know who the murderer is
[Speaker 2] corey there's one problem with your plan yeah we'd be dead
[Interviewee] oh oh yeah that that's kinda right
[Speaker 3] yeah that is actually the worst idea you coulda came up with
[Interviewee] oh my yo dude okay sorry that's my fault okay you know what how we just all walk out of here and we'll just keep exploring
[Speaker 2] sure sounds good
[Interviewee] okay here we go let's get out of here dude and what the heck wait the lights are not forgetting wait i think i heard someone scream oh no oh no oh no and kai what did you do to ziggy
[Speaker 3] oh nothing corey
[Interviewee] no way is is he oh my gosh he's dead kai were you were you the murderer
[Speaker 3] no he he's just dead tie
[Interviewee] what what do you mean dead tiered he's dead
[Speaker 3] oh looks to be that way doesn't it
[Interviewee] oh my gosh kai but how i out of everyone i never suspected you bro you you're just not smart enough if i'm gonna be honest you're you're kinda dumb
[Speaker 3] and that's the reason why corey every day you guys are always making fun of me so what not better way to do it than to kill every single one of you
[Interviewee] okay listen i i you know what yeah we you know we don't have to call you dumb anymore you know what color you smart just how about how about you put the knife away and we talk about this give me one good reason why because you know
[Speaker 3] well it's too late now corey i might as well kill you especially since ziggy was a sheriff he told me he was like a sheriff
[Interviewee] what what do you mean ziggy was a sheriff
[Speaker 3] yeah you said it right in front of me and star
[Interviewee] wait so so you killed him because of that what kai put your hands in the air you're the sheriff well i don't know why ziggy said he was a sheriff dude i mean you doziggy he lies all the time like that
[Speaker 3] yeah why would he lie though
[Interviewee] he's probably a shutdown press star or something
[Speaker 3] give me one second corey you idiot alright back
[Interviewee] to you oh my gosh he's dead anyways well kai it's i guess it's you against me
[Speaker 3] no no whatever you do corey please
