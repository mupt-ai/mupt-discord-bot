infinity hearts i can well you'll have to see that for yourselves okay and wait where's all my heart oh yeah i forgot i just have one giant heart but that is one hardly looking heart and if i take damage hold though oh gosh yeah i do not have any out that all this means i have to be super duper careful because pretty much a flower could kill me right now isn't that right mister pig he's just looking into the wall and oh there you go buddy oh now his face is back in there this is a kartik i'm getting rid of it but i also spotted with this guidebook and oh is that what the infinity heart's gonna look like that is actually awesome and those should all give me different powers okay and the first heart should be the mine heart look up to fly and sneak in the air to boost wait what it's the first fragment of the heart and we can hardly fly to this is awesome so we just need one piece of dirt and ore seeds okay give me all the seeds give me all the seeds why are there literally no seeds dropping oh gosh is that pig hello there give me your seeds mister piggy oh he actually just pooped it out perfect okay we just need one more now and boom we got the four c so let's just grab some wood now to make a crafting table and i wonder if i get the entire heart then i could just like destroy worlds in it instant like if i snap my fingers is everything just gonna collapse i don't know we'll see we'll see alright we got wood so let's make that into a beautiful crafting table and now it should be wonder in the middle and the four c's across why isn't it working wait wait did i do this wrong oh my goodness it's one seat in ford turf i thought it was the other way around oh so we got all those seats for nothing i knew i shouldn't have beat up that pig okay so four dirt just like that in a seat in the middle and boom we got the mine hornet we can look at the fly and sneak in the air to boost or if i look up that am i flying i'm not flying wait do i have to do i have to sneak up oh my goodness wait hold up how did i just do that okay so i look up and and then i sneak is that what would happen i'm so confused do i have to jump herself to oh okay i see okay now it's working

can glide in the air too oh that's actually awesome this literally means i can never take fall of the image again and hold on when i crafted the heart i also got these four purple thingies it's called thanosight what is this the poop of thanos do i have dano poop of my hands okay well let's check out what the next heart is it's the power heart and it gives you strength and speed on taking damage i need four gravestones and one sugar you know what that is not hard at all i will take that me just break this crafting table yank and i guess we need to go mining so first things first let's go grab some more wood the tree is so far but you know what i can fly there yes but there's much cooler ones in this heart so i'm excited okay we got all the woods so now we're just gonna make ourselves a nice little big ax and now we just go digging for the cobblestone and wait it was four cobblestone one sugar not the other way around oh where am i gonna go fight sugar to find one of those bamboo and looking thingies what is it called again is sugarcane i have to go find sugarcane haven't been playing minecraft for this long and still not what should a game is while we're here let's just grab a bunch of calls so so we can make ourselves a full set of tools real quick alright should be good let me head back up and now i'm gonna make myself a pickaxe i'm also gonna make myself a sword let me also make myself an axe just like that and now we have to go find some sugarcane but that's gonna next to a sand so maybe like a beachy area oh you know what we're gonna be able to find this super easily because i'm just gonna fly around oh we are such a good idea let me just float straight up into this guy like super high i'm just gonna let take a glide everywhere then i'm gonna be able to find it so easily alright now let's just okay you know what that did not work at all oh and wait wait i see sugargate i see the sugargate let me go grab that real quick oh my goodness i've been searching for this for so long hello missus sugarcane it's so very nice to meet you here we are chicago oh thank you so much pressure doing business with you so now we just pop this in here we should get our eight sugar and let's just surround this with cabo so to get our power you know oh and now if we take damage it should give us strength and speed and it also gave us more than a side i'm not sure what this is maybe i can craft stuff with it like can i craft the leggings or oh my goodness wait i actually can oh love oh my goodness protection five wait this is actually so opioid let let me just put that on yo i have fit it out this means i don't only get super powers i also get super opiant items so let's see what it can make i'm really excited to see the sword they might be insanely overpowered but that means we have to get more hearts and speaking of hearts let's see what this power heart does let me take some fall damage real quick and oh my goodness i i completely forgot i can't even take damage
how do i die wait okay what if i just go in the water and run out a breath now we gotta wait alright let's see i took damage and oh okay okay and give a straight five in speed to hand regenerator duration oh my goodness wait that is actually so overpowered but it runs out real quickly okay i mean that's pretty okay though for fighting a bunch of mobs what's the next heart let's see it's the reality heart and if some is random items on taking damage and we need four iron and one cold to make it and that means oh we need to go my mining and mining means a lot of monsters but thankfully i got the power hard there to help me out so let's go find a k up up way and beyond i just realize i'm like farting to fly this is so funny and oh okay i find a really nice looking cave right here so let's drop in and okay let's go find some iron oh you're an iron oh there's a creeper right there there that is a creeper they get oh gosh no no iron he really does blow up my iron really okay well we found some iron here so let's just grab all of this room quickly and now let's just dig down i'm gonna see if i can find some more iron just in case and i also need to make myself some basic armor even though i do have the super opus thanos i leggings is there any more iron here i haven't found something in a long time and wait oh my goodness wait this place is huge and okay that's another grape alright chill bro chill chill chill okay okay calm down calm down i have to remember even though i am op i have really little heart so this could end up really bad alright safely got rid of it and there looks to be more i oh gosh no no no no no no no oh my goodness oh my goodness please regenerate regenerate regenerate i almost just guys did a lava oh and i don't have any food too and oh gosh there's so many mobs here oh gosh okay okay we gotta try to kill them come on die die i'd wait they're actually dying in one shot though which is really helpful no stop it oh diamonds wait diamonds i don't have a big x to get it though no gonna dodge all these guys get away robbie i'm gonna fly away i'm gonna fly alright we're safely on the other side let me just grab some cobblestone to like block myself in real quick because these mobs are actually gonna end up killing me and now that we got our iron let's make a furnace and smelt it real quickly we got our four iron so now let's just place this around like this and place our cobble stuff wait hold up did i get the recipe wrong again oh gosh oh okay okay so one cold that's all we need so let's go grab that real quick oh gosh some mobs are shooting at me again already please i just need one piece of cool that that's it that's it how is there no cooler i see more diamonds than i see coal oh wait there's coal it no there's not there's literally no coal how is this possible oh my goodness we came all the way to like a different underground dimension to find this coal and there's still more diamonds i'm finding way more diamonds than i am coal right now wait i see coal i see coal oh my goodness finally i have never been this happy of my life to find coal before usually it's just like way too much and i wanna get rid of it but there we go we got our one cool and we gotta make another crafting table since we lost our other one so let's surround this iron and boom reality hard and it's sponsored random items on taking damage that should be pretty cool because there's a bunch of mobs right here waiting to kill me and i only got one thanos site this time so i can't make the sword quite yet but let's see what these babies do come here mister come here they're talking me yes and oh wait it's actually dropping random items hold on hold on wait this is good this actually okay okay you know what maybe that's a little bit too much did i just gonna dodge apple oh my goodness wait a minute this is actually so opi this is the best one so far i just have to be super dupe careful that it doesn't actually kill me because i don't have like a lot of hearts right now alright yes keep dropping good stuff off bunnies i'll take the cold booties and okay okay that that's good that's good you're you're good bro it's all good it's okay we're done we're done a minute what did i just drop and what is this is this a it dropped a soul wait why do i have two souls of babies okay okay guys yeah give me a second i'm trying to do something here gosh it's so rude just interrupting me while i'm trying to record okay let's take a look at this thing oh my goodness that looks crazy cool does that have any special powers i can't do any thing with it wait let's check the guidebook maybe i'll say something about it okay it shows up here and it's a soul heart hit mobs to get special effects mobs drop souls oh okay so we gotta use this to craft our next part of the heart that makes sense but first things first let's actually get completely looted up because we're gonna be taking a lot of damage and i don't wanna die so let's make ourselves a full set of iron armor too but let me eat this cake first no no no so much better already okay time to go mining you know what while we're getting an iron let's just go grab our diamond too because there is just way too many to pass up so let's just grab these bad boys real quick and we should have enough of everything so let's go back to our furnace and smell these guys alright let's make ourselves some iron armor there we go and oh my goodness we are fitted out we can literally take on anything now but now that that's done let's go grab two more souls just so we can make our next heart so let's kill this guy and let's kill this guy and that should be enough in wait a minute would it just drop did it just give me a timing sword this is enchanted too that's awesome alright there's a lot of mobs here let's get out of here okay we're back and now we just need to glass bottle and thankfully we did get a bunch of potions just now i got a potion of haste three and a potion of leaping so let's drink this potion we have a glass bottle and now we put that in the middle and put the souls like this we get the soul hard and hitting mobs will give potion effects yes this is awesome i'm literally so overpowered a hey everyone who was chasing me before where do you at oh yeah look at that look at that guy just disappeared he doesn't they do not want to mess with me they are just disappearing wait why they actually disappearing okay let's go find them out come here everyone don't come here and oh my goodness it just gives me a bunch of random effects wait a minute what it gives me bad effects two i have longer three but i also have saturation three so how does that work exactly oh you know what and i'm asking you let's just kill these guys don't die everyone here and they're all dead oh my goodness that was the most obvious thing i've ever seen but now that i also look at it i have three more thanosites so this means i could make a thanosite sword and with the oh my goodness really these moms aren't so rude oh wait can i make a thanos ax is that also a thing okay no that's not a thing but a sword is a thing at home only moly lockamolly what is this i'm gonna throw this diamond sword away because obviously this my gosh two hundred percent knock back resisting one hundred percent speed and one thousand attack damage this can literally kill the ener dragon in one hit want getting the rest of the hearts is gonna be so easy things to this so let's see what the next one is it's the space heart and you need four gold and an and their pearl to make it alright that doesn't seem that bad all of that should be in the netherlands and we have to go there anywhere for the blaze rods so let's go back to the surface and find a lava pool real quickly be home sweet home no mobs just littleiggies and wait i kinda wanna test out the infinity sword real quick are you sure about that yeah oh it's just an insecure everything just dies no matter what i can literally spam click and just kill them this is so alright let's go find a lava pool where that where that oh there it is sound one perfect so let's grab the water bucket and just make the porter real quickly boom popping boom boom boom boom thank you ma'am bob bye bye bing bing bing pow let's light this baby up and let's go inside oh gosh ready to respond let me fly up there real quickly and wait wait a minute what i can't even fly anymore hold on am i glitching oh my goodness i can't fly another this means i have to walk like a visit oh wait what the why did i just ran normally start float wait what what is happening why am i flying now okay i guess that far move doesn't work but i guess still levitate when i look up i mean it's better than nothing i so we need four gold so i'm just gonna steal these guys because it's the easiest way to go and then we also need an ender pearl and hopefully we can find that at the fortress or find an enderman on the way there so we got all the nuggets chicken nuggets and now we gotta find the fortress to real quickly and oh i found it i found it i found it yes let's go and oh wait i could phone again too okay perfect one great thing after another and oh my goodness that is a lot of other skeletons wait why have i been scared i have my abilities what wait a minute it doesn't kill them right away on one shot but this is a thousand attack damage how is this possible i literally got scammed oh gosh this is not gonna be as easy as i but now we just gotta kill these blazes and okay these guys are mad at me let's grab that and block of diamond i'll take that gladly oh gosh okay let's just keep killing all of these guys guys come here mister blaze's give me your blaze rods okay i should have enough let's just get out of here now because these guys are really echoing on me play away oh get started on oh gosh no no no no not at all not at all not at all not at all okay but by my far journey just kinda failed there but we also need to get an end up pro but let's just sit in the over world because this is just way too scary still and to home we go okay we're back let's go find some enderman now and wait wait a minute what wait how do i have six end their pearls oh it must have been one of those random items i draw you know what that's actually perfect now we don't have to go fight an enderman too and this means we can make the next heart right away so let's make another crafting table and it was four gold like this and one other pearl in the middle to get the space heart and uh-oh gosh sneek right click to teleport in the direction you face and i literally like it edder in wait this is better than flying flying i still have to move but now i don't even have to move it's literally just helping me get lazier and lazier so i can fly and i can teleport oh my goodness perfect thank you for spoiling me and now we can also head to the end portal to get to the end of your dragon and beat the game but we do have one more heart and that is the time hard which is four redstone and one clock how do you make a clock wait a minute now i'm thinking about it i literally don't know how to make a clock how to make cut off oh it's four gold and one redstone that shouldn't be too bad we already have the gold now we just need the red and instead of going back into a cave to get it i think i have a better idea oh my goodness the pain the pain but i'm also dropping a bunch of items please be read don't hurry if this works i'm actually a genius come on drop me red so drop me red so please it literally dropped me another right enchanted home but no redstone yet and wait and also drop me another right helmet oh gosh okay i'll i'll take that wait wait drop redstone drop redstone yes come on oh my goodness please be enough and we have how how much redstone six redstone said okay that's perfect that's actually perfect i can finally make the last heart so we gotta a clock first and then we're gonna surround the clock with a redstone to get the time heart and oh my goodness wait what did this give me it gave me an infinity bow which looks absolutely awesome oh and she was flaming arrows is that sick and what else right click while looking at a mob to send them to dark dimension to dark dimension what let me try it on these moms real quick okay so if i just look at a mom and then i right click on me oh my goodness wait think it's just a bear oh my goodness this is so open i can't literally just get rid of them instantly they don't die because they don't drop anything but they get sent to the dark dimension they're probably so confusing that right now going i'll look at this one he's mad he's mad that i took away his brothers don't worry you'll be joining them oh gosh oh that was hilarious wait that means i can technically beat the end of dragon in one second but before we go and try that out let me also make some more armor with dano side i'm gonna get the dano side chest plate oh thank you give me that and i also make myself some gold booties and i am ready to take on the adler dragon so which direction is it that way okay perfect let's go find the fortress do this again and wait it went straight into the ground this time okay okay we're right above the stronghold now we just gotta dig straight down let me drink my hace potion to make this go faster you know what never mind the water ruined it for me i just locked this up and oh we made it yes we made it oh get out of your moms oh my goodness yes where's the portal room where's this portal room please portal room where are you imagine the portal room actually responds i i'm right here wait why it's right here oh my goodness what the heck that's actually so unexpected maybe it actually was able to hear me but now we got it all set up so let's just alright can you chill can you chill but before so really interrupted i was saying
