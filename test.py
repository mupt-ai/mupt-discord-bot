a = [{"question": "How did you feel when your trap didn't work as planned?", "answer": "I was frustrated because I had put so much effort into making the trap and it turned out to be useless. I had to think of a new trap quickly."}, {"question": "What was your new plan for a trap?", "answer": "My new plan was to build a railroad system and along the way, place end crystals. I can then shoot the end crystals as he's going past them. I think that might be my best play here."}, {"question": "Did you encounter any setbacks in building this new trap?", "answer": "I had wasted so much iron on the mine carts that didn't work that I wasn't sure I'd have enough to build the railroad system and the end crystals."}, {"question": "What were your feelings after you completed the roller coaster trap?", "answer": "I felt accomplished but also anxious because Mind Commander could get on at any moment. But I was also hopeful because I knew that my trap had potential to work."}, {"question": "How did you feel when you were banned from the SMP?", "answer": "I was shocked and disappointed. I had been working hard to survive and then, just like that, I was banned because someone found me and killed me."}, {"question": "How did you feel when you were revived on the SMP?", "answer": "I was surprised and grateful. Someone on the SMP, a fan, decided to sacrifice ten hearts to revive me. I was very lucky."}, {"question": "What happened when you logged back on the SMP?", "answer": "I found out that Terrain, a member of the actual SMP, was online the same time I was. He warned me about Mind Manor, which made me even more determined to come up with a good trap."}, {"question": "What was your reaction when you discovered that your items had been stolen while you were offline?", "answer": "I was frustrated because that meant I had to start over. But I didn't want to do that, so I got some help from others on the server."}, {"question": "How did you feel when you received help from others on the server?", "answer": "I was relieved and grateful. They gave me a bunch of iron which was exactly what I needed to make my trap."}, {"question": "What did you learn from this experience?", "answer": "I learned to never leave my stuff outside and just log off, and that people on the server are really nice."}, {"question": "What was your plan after getting enough iron?", "answer": "My plan was to make a bunch of mine carts so we can make the trap. I also decided to make a base because I really don't wanna lose all my stuff again."}, {"question": "How do you feel about joining an anarchy server where there are no rules at all?", "answer": "I like a challenge, that's why I'm gonna join this hacker only S&P."}, {"question": "How do you feel about the fact that players on this server hate newcomers?", "answer": "It's a weird thing about the players on this S&P, they hate newcomers and will do anything to not let them play, but I'm up for the challenge."}, {"question": "How do you plan to navigate the challenge of choosing the right nether portal?", "answer": "I gotta figure out which one to go into because if I'm not careful I could get trapped. I'm just gonna go in this one and pray for the best."}, {"question": "How do you feel about your plans not working out the way you expected?", "answer": "After many attempts and a lot and a lot of fails, I came to the conclusion that there was no way this was gonna work. Everything seemed hopeless and I was about to give up."}, {"question": "How do you feel about downloading the hacks?", "answer": "It wasn't something I wanted to do, but I needed to. This is like a pretty good hack client, so why not."}, {"question": "How do you feel about finally finding a hacker to face off with?", "answer": "I was nervous, but ready. Now all I have to do is find a hacker and kill them. I finally have a chance."}, {"question": "How did you feel after your first fight with a hacker ended?", "answer": "It didn't go as planned. I forgot about a very important fact, my ping on the 2b2t server is terrible. But I didn't give up. I knew I had to try again."}, {"question": "How do you feel about the way the hackers have manipulated the server?", "answer": "It's a mess. They've completely destroyed spawn, trapped the nether portals, killed all the animals around spawn. It's brutal, but it's part of what makes this server what it is."}, {"question": "How do you feel about the encounters you've had with hackers so far?", "answer": "I can knock kill a hacker right now, they can literally kill me in an instant. It's scary, but it's part of the challenge."}, {"question": "How do you feel about having to ask for help in the chat?", "answer": "I didn't wanna resort to asking a player, but it was my last option. It's not ideal, but I needed the help."}]
